<h1>The Real Life RPG System</h1>

<h2> Basics </h2>

<p> In order to gamify your life, you can make a character sheet of yourself to 'numberify' your progress. To do that you need to know how RPG game character sheets work. In this section I aim to explain that.</p>

<h2>Stat points</h2>

    <p>In order to implement this system, one must understand first the basic principles of RPG system design. In games all characters have attributes that describe their strength and weaknesses. These attributes are called stat points. I personally use a mix of two systems  (Fantasy Age and DnD table-top RPGs), so I am taking stats from there. Each of these contains skills that are explained further down.</p>

    <ul class="ul--dash">
        <li> <h3>Charisma<a title="taken from DnD">*</a>:</h3></li>
        <p> In DnD  system physical attractiveness is  part of charisma, since IRL 'pretty privilege'<a href="https://www.myimperfectlife.com/features/pretty-privilege">*</a> exists.*  In my system the things you can improve about your appearance are covered by charisma such as body composition and style.</p>

        <h4> Example Skills</h4>
        <ul class="ul--dash" >
            <li> Style (as in clothes)  </li>
            <li> Body composition (Muscle/Fat/BMI)  </li>
        </ul>

        <li> <h3>Communication:</h3></li>
        <p>  In RPG-s this usually covers all sorts of social skills, such as bargaining, persuasiveness etc. It covers verbal and non-verbal communication skills as well.</p>

        <h4> Example Skills</h4>
        <ul class="ul--dash">
            <li> Kindness  </li>
            <li>Acceptance </li>
        </ul>

        <li><h3> Perception:</h3></li>
        <p>   Perception boils down to awareness both of your physical and social surroundings. In this sense empathy for me is part of perception, as it requires us to be aware of our social environment. Since mindfulness is also part of perception, since it's literally the state or the practice of awareness.</p>

        <h4> Example Skills</h4>
        <ul class="ul--dash">
            <li>Mindfulness </li>
            <li>Empathy</li>
        </ul>

        <li> <h3>Willpower:</h3></li>
        <p>    Willpower is pretty self-explanatory too. It means how well you can control yourself. For example how diligent are you depend on your willpower.</p>

        <h4> Example Skills</h4>
        <ul class="ul--dash">
            <li>Patience </li>
            <li>Diligence</li>
        </ul>

        <li> <h3>Intelligence:</h3></li>
        <p>   Although generally speaking this seems as an inherited unchangeable value for us, in RPG systems skills that require mental work are connected to it. In this system although knowledge would be a better word to describe what I put under this category to keep the RPG format I didn't change it.</p>

        <h4> Example Skills</h4>
        <ul class="ul--dash">
            <li>Mathematics </li>
            <li> Python</li>
            <li>Webdev</li>
            <li> Javascript</li>
            <li>Linux </li>
            <li> German</li>
        </ul>

        <li> <h3>Dexterity:</h3></li>
        <p>   This is a physical stat. The word is also self-explanatory. Dexterity describes  a skill in performing tasks, especially with the hands (or your body). Thus, how well you type for e.g. is part of your dexterity, but also almost all technical skills.</p>

        <h4> Example Skills</h4>
        <ul class="ul--dash">
            <li>Piano </li>
            <li> Typing</li>
            <li>Swimming technique</li>
            <li> Archery </li>
            <li>Embroidery </li>
            <li> German</li>
        </ul>

        <li><h3> Constitution:</h3></li>
        <p>    It describes one's stamina, ability to endure. Endurance sports go under this stat, but I would also consider pain tolerance for e.g. part of this.</p>

        <h4> Example Skills</h4>
        <ul class="ul--dash">
            <li>Swimming distance</li>
            <li>Running distance</li>
            <li>Cycling distance</li>
           <p>(Any endurance sport)</p>
        </ul>

        <li> <h3>Strength: </h3></li>
        <p>     It describes one's physical strength, I also take endurance sport's speed under this.</p>

        <h4> Example Skills</h4>
        <ul class="ul--dash">
            <li>Weightlifting</li>
            <li>Swimming speed</li>
            <li>Running speed</li>
            <p> (for speed more muscle strength is required see sprinters body composition vs. endurance athlete's)</p>
        </ul>

    </ul>

    <h2> Stat point calculation</h2>

    <p>   These are assigned under the different stat points. All your skills can be assigned to a stat point ideally, but sometimes you have to get creative. For example I put swimming distance under Constitution as it requires endurance, but swimming technique under dexterity, as it is a kinetic technique and these require dexterity. To get my attribute points or stat points I avarage the skill levels that are connected to the stat I want to calculate.</p>

    <h3>For example:</h3>
    <p>If under Intelligence I have the following skills:</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>Python</td>
            <td> lvl 6</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Webdev </td>
            <td>lvl 3 </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Chinese</td>
            <td> lvl 21</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Mathematics</td>
            <td> lvl 12</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p> Then the average of these levels (10,5) rounded down (10) is my Intelligence point. Thus:</p>
    <p>  INT: 10</p>
    <p>So if I progress in any of these skills I can up my INT points. </p>
    <p>   With this system I can see at a glance how much improvement  I make not only on individual skills but on  different areas of life such as the Social (COM, PER,) Physical aspect (CON, STR, DEX), Mental (WILL, PER). </p>

    <h2> Gaining skill levels </h2>
<p>
    My system is based on self-assessment. Meaning you asses how much you have improved, and based on that you give yourself points on that skill (this way small improvements are visible as well in the forms of points versus general statements as I became a novice or sth like that - although milestones like that are part of the system as well).
</p>

    <p> I have a conversion table, when the points exceed the limit you level up.</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Level</th>
            <th> Lvl up points</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>1-5</td>
            <td> 5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>6-10 </td>
            <td>10 </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>11-15</td>
            <td> 20</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>16-20</td>
            <td> 40</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>21-25</td>
            <td> 80</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>26-30</td>
            <td> 160</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>31-40</td>
            <td> 320 </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>41-50</td>
            <td> 640 </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>51-70</td>
            <td> 1280 </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>71-1000</td>
            <td> 2560 </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p> Each time you reach 5 points in from lvl 1 - 5 you level up. So each level up in that range takes 5 points, however as you level up it takes more and more points to level up. I designed it that way, because IRL the more skilled you are the harder it is to see "actual level up" in your skill. Improvements always seem huge when you begin to practice any skill and dwindle down as you progress. </p>

    <p> It is important to note again, that the system is based on self-assessment, meaning it is up to you to decide how many points you give yourself, how much you improved, since in my philosophy one's progress should be examined in the context of their own journey, own skills and on their past performance. I believe that one shouldn't really compare themselves with others (except for their expertise whatever that may be), but I digress if you want to read about it Google really is your friend. If you feel like this system could help you give it a go, and modify it if you feel like it.</p>
